<h6 id="indianapolis-in-1">Indianapolis, IN</h6>
<p>Initiated and advocated the use of cloud computing for production and ad hoc needs, such as testing and demos. Used Amazons Web Services EC2 instances (Linux and Windows images) with Elastic Block Storage for data persistence beyond the instance, removing the need for many in- house servers and allowing the organization to take advantage of the high performance, pay-as- you-go pricing model.</p>
<p>Designed and implemented a custom RDF triplestore using a relation database and vertical partitioning, abstracting the SQL statements so that different databases could be used, e.g. MySQL, Oracle, HSQLDB, PostgreSQL. This triplestore served as the foundation for data persistence of Indigo products, freeing developers from the traditional object-relational mapping concerns. (Java, Spring, RDF)</p>
<p>Created a RESTful web service API for Indigo’s custom triplestore, translating SPARQL queries into SQL statements which facilitated the publication of linked data. Designed Indigo’s lab automation framework, a modularized web-based platform that automates the collection and analysis of lab data. (Java, Spring, JSP)</p>
<p>Developed ontologies to describe lab data collection and analysis. Translated these ontologies into RDF schema. (RDF, RDFS, N-Triple, OWL)</p>
<p>Conducted interviews using Joel on Software’s Smart and Gets Things Done, making hiring decisions for new developers and interns.</p>
<p>Refactored a legacy web-app to use the Spring Framework and hibernate, freeing it from technology lock-in and simplifying the development environment, speeding up development and allowing for more diverse deployment environments. (Java, Spring, Hibernate, Tomcat, Glassfish, Sun AppServer 7, SOAP, Lucene, Centera)</p>
